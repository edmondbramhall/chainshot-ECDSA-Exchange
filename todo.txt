Fix defect
Stop taking the public key of the sender from the UI and calculate it 
  client-side from the private key just before we send
Use short exchange addresses
Validate amount input client-side for consistency
Show total amount in the exchange in the UI, and validate that we always have
  the same amount in the server
Can we move code into a shared class, does that work?
